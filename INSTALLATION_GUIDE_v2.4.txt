1. Double-click "Launch_ORCAView.bat" OR
2. Navigate to "dist\ORCAView\" and double-click "ORCAView.exe"
3. Set your ORCA executable path in the Submission tab
4. Start creating quantum chemistry calculations!

📦 WHAT YOU GET:
✅ Fully portable Windows application (no installation required)
✅ All dependencies included (~715 MB total)
✅ Intelligent method combination evaluation system
✅ Complete Pople basis set coverage (60+ basis sets)
✅ Advanced 3D molecular visualization
✅ Integrated job queue management
✅ Ketcher molecular editor

🔧 DETAILED SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1: Extract/Copy Files
- Copy the entire "ORCAView" folder to your desired location
- Recommended: C:\ORCAView\ or Desktop\ORCAView\
- Ensure you have ~1 GB free space

STEP 2: First Launch
- Double-click "ORCAView.exe" (may take 10-15 seconds to start)
- Windows may show security warning - click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Application will open with the Coordinates tab active

STEP 3: Configure ORCA Path
- Click on the "Submission" tab
- Click "Browse..." next to "ORCA Executable Path"
- Navigate to your ORCA installation directory
- Select "orca.exe" (typically in C:\orca_6_0_0\ or similar)
- Path is automatically saved for future sessions

STEP 4: Test the Setup
- Go to "Coordinates" tab
- Enter a simple molecule (e.g., "CCO" for ethanol)
- Click "Generate 3D Structure from SMILES"
- Go to "Method" tab and select B3LYP/def2-SVP
- Go to "Submission" tab and click "Generate Input"
- Verify ORCA input is generated correctly

- Real-time assessment of method combinations
- Letter grades (A+ to D) with confidence levels
- Cost-accuracy analysis with system size recommendations
- Application-specific guidance (Organic Chemistry, Transition Metals, etc.)

Enhanced Method Database:
- Complete Pople coverage: 6-31G through 6-311++G(3df,3pd)
- 50+ DFT functionals with detailed descriptions
- Quality scoring (3.0-9.8 scale) for accuracy assessment
- Specific warnings and improvement suggestions

User Experience Improvements:
- Full-height info window (no more scrolling!)
- Larger 12px font size for better readability
- Component details shown first, then combination assessment
- Clear visual separation with horizontal dividers

⚙️ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit) - Required
- 2 GB RAM - Recommended (1 GB minimum)
- 1 GB free disk space - For application and temporary files
- Graphics card with OpenGL 2.1+ - For 3D visualization
- ORCA 5.0+ - Separate installation required

🎨 USING THE MOLECULAR EDITOR:
1. Click "Draw Molecule (Ketcher)" in Coordinates tab
2. Draw your molecule in the 2D editor
3. Click "Save" in Ketcher, then close the editor window
4. SMILES string will be automatically imported
5. Click "Generate 3D Structure from SMILES"

📊 CREATING CALCULATIONS:
1. Load/generate molecular structure
2. Choose method in "Method" tab (see intelligent recommendations!)
3. Set job type in "Job Type" tab
4. Configure solvation if needed in "Solvation" tab
5. Add custom keywords in "Input Blocks" tab (optional)
6. Generate and submit in "Submission" tab

🔄 JOB QUEUE MANAGEMENT:
- Monitor running calculations in "Job Queue" tab
- Real-time status updates (Queued → Running → Done)
- Cancel jobs, reorder queue, view live output
- Remove finished jobs individually or in bulk

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Application Won't Start:
- Run as administrator
- Check Windows Defender/antivirus settings
- Ensure all files are in the same folder
- Try launching from command prompt for error messages

3D Viewer Issues:
- Update graphics drivers
- Try running in compatibility mode
- Check OpenGL support with GPU-Z or similar tool

ORCA Integration Problems:
- Verify ORCA path points to correct executable
- Test ORCA manually from command line
- Check file permissions in working directory
- Ensure ORCA license is valid

Performance Issues:
- Run from local drive (not network/USB)
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Increase virtual memory if needed
- Consider SSD for better I/O performance

🌐 NETWORK USAGE:
- Ketcher editor requires internet for first-time setup
- All other features work completely offline
- No data is transmitted to external servers

🔒 SECURITY NOTES:
- Application is digitally signed and safe
- Windows SmartScreen may show warning on first run
- Antivirus may scan executable - this is normal
- No network communication except for Ketcher editor

- Issue Tracker: Report bugs via GitHub Issues
- Documentation: Complete README.md in source repository
- Community: ORCA Forum for quantum chemistry questions

🏆 PERFORMANCE TIPS:
- Use SSD for better startup and file I/O performance
- Close unnecessary applications to free RAM
- For large molecules (>100 atoms), use smaller basis sets initially
- Enable hardware acceleration in graphics settings
