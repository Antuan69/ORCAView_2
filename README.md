### July 2025 Update
- **Official ORCA 6.1 Basis Sets:** The DFT and HF basis set dropdowns now use grouped, deduplicated lists directly from the ORCA 6.1 manual (Karlsruhe def2, Ahlrichs, Pople, etc.) for full compliance and user clarity.
- **Robust Windows Job Cancellation:** Cancelling a job now kills all ORCA-related processes (orca.exe, MPI, children) using native Windows process tree termination.
- **Batch Queue Stability:** The batch job queue is fully automaticâ€”jobs start immediately after submission, and the UI remains responsive.
- **No PyVista Dependency:** The 3D viewer is now Vispy-only. PyVista is no longer required or supported.
- **requirements.txt is current** and matches all features.
- **All jobs are launched via batch files** for maximum compatibility with Windows and ORCA's official recommendations.

ORCAView is a powerful PyQt6 desktop application for molecular visualization, editing, and automated ORCA quantum chemistry job submission with advanced batch queue management.

## Features

- **Ketcher Integration**: Draw and edit molecules using the Ketcher web-based editor embedded in the app.
- **RDKit Backend**: SMILES parsing, 3D coordinate generation, and pre-optimization.
- **2D and 3D Visualization**: View molecules in 2D and interactive 3D.
- **Advanced 3D Rendering**: Vispy-based viewer with smooth tube/cylinder bonds and rounded, lit end-caps (no PyVista required).
- **Official Basis Set Dropdowns**: DFT and HF basis set selectors now present all official ORCA 6.1 basis sets, grouped by family (Karlsruhe def2, Ahlrichs, Pople, etc.) for clarity and accuracy.
- **Batch Job Queue System**: Queue multiple ORCA jobs for sequential execution. Jobs are launched via robust Windows batch files for maximum compatibility.
- **Queue UI Controls**: View queued, running, and completed jobs. Cancel or reorder jobs interactively from the GUI.
- **Full Logging and Diagnostics**: All job launches and errors are logged for easy troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

- PyQt6
- PyQt6-WebEngine
- Flask
- numpy < 2.0
- rdkit-pypi
- Pygments
- vispy

## Usage

### Application
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Use the Ketcher editor to draw a molecule and generate a 3D structure.
4. Submit ORCA jobs via the GUI. Jobs are queued and processed one-by-one.
5. Monitor job progress, cancel, or reorder jobs in the "Job Queue" tab.

### ORCA Job Submission (Windows)
- Jobs are submitted by generating a temporary batch file that launches ORCA with the correct environment and working directory.
- All paths use Windows backslashes for compatibility.
- Input files are generated with correct ORCA block formatting (no 'end' for %maxcore; all other blocks properly closed).

### Troubleshooting
- If a job fails:
  - Check the job's output and error logs in the GUI or in the output files.
  - Common errors include input geometry mismatches (see below).
  - Try running the generated batch file manually to isolate environment issues.
- If the UI does not update after a job finishes, switch tabs or submit a new job to refresh.

### Advanced Usage & Known Issues
- **Input Geometry Mismatch**: If you see errors like `Input geometry does not match current geometry`, ensure you are not referencing restart files or old `.gbw` files. Delete old scratch/restart files before rerunning.
- **Queue Robustness**: The batch queue system is thread-safe and will not deadlock the UI. All job processing is handled in a background thread.
- **No PyVista**: The 3D viewer is now fully Vispy-based. PyVista is no longer required or supported.

## Contribution & Development
- All source code is in the `orcaview` directory.
- Requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.
