- **Enhanced Job Queue Management:**
    - Queue up multiple ORCA calculations to run sequentially without generating .bat files.
    - Monitor job status (Queued, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled) with real-time updates.
    - Cancel running jobs and manage the queue order.
    - Remove individual finished jobs or bulk remove all finished jobs via context menu.
    - View live output files for running calculations.
- **Flexible Input Generation:** Supports comprehensive ORCA method coverage including 80+ DFT functionals, 100+ basis sets, all ORCA 6.1 semiempirical methods, xTB methods, solvation models, and custom keywords.
- **Save Input File Only:** New option to save generated ORCA input files without submitting to job queue.

## Installation and Usage

To run ORCAView from source, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   An installation of the [ORCA Quantum Chemistry Program](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/).
    -   Python 3.9+

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ORCAView
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Set up Ketcher (Optional):**
    To use the Ketcher molecular editor, you must download and extract it:
    - Download `ketcher-standalone-3.4.0.zip`.
    - Unzip its contents into the `orcaview/ketcher/` directory.
    - The final structure should be `orcaview/ketcher/standalone/index.html`.
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Building a Portable Version (Windows)

A portable, folder-based distribution can be created using the included `build_portable.spec` file.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Run the build:**
    From the root of the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller build_portable.spec --noconfirm

    The build process is configured to automatically exclude `PySide6` to prevent conflicts with `PyQt6`.
    ```

3.  The complete, portable application will be located in the `dist/ORCAView` directory.
