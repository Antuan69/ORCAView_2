                    ORCAView v2.4 - MPI Troubleshooting Guide
================================================================================

üîß MPI ERROR FIXED!

The error "'mpiexec' is not recognized as an internal or external command" 
has been RESOLVED in this version of ORCAView v2.4.

‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Automatic MPI detection and fallback to serial execution
- Smart input file modification for systems without MPI
- Enhanced environment variable setup for ORCA compatibility
- Improved error handling for parallel execution scenarios

üß† HOW THE FIX WORKS:

1. **MPI Detection**: ORCAView automatically checks if mpiexec is available
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If MPI is not found, forces serial execution
3. **Input File Modification**: Automatically adds/modifies %pal block with "nprocs 1"
4. **Environment Setup**: Sets ORCA_NPROCS=1 and disables MPI warnings

üéØ USER EXPERIENCE:
- **No user action required** - the fix is automatic
- **Works on any system** - with or without MPI installed
- **Maintains performance** - uses parallel execution when available
- **Silent operation** - no error messages or warnings

üìä TECHNICAL DETAILS:

Before Fix:
```
Error: 'mpiexec' is not recognized as an internal or external command
ORCA calculation fails to start
```

After Fix:
```
‚úÖ MPI not available - forcing serial execution
‚úÖ Modifying input file for serial execution  
‚úÖ Input file modified for serial execution
‚úÖ ORCA LAUNCHED, WAITING FOR COMPLETION
```

üîç WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY:

1. **MPI Check**: Tests if `mpiexec --version` works
2. **Environment Setup**: If MPI missing, sets:
   - ORCA_NPROCS=1
   - ORCA_MPI_PROCS=1
   - OMPI_MCA_btl_base_warn_component_unused=0
3. **Input Modification**: Adds or modifies %pal block:
   ```
   %pal
      nprocs 1
   end
   ```

‚öôÔ∏è COMPATIBILITY:
- ‚úÖ Systems WITH MPI: Uses parallel execution normally
- ‚úÖ Systems WITHOUT MPI: Automatically switches to serial mode
- ‚úÖ Portable applications: Works without any MPI installation
- ‚úÖ Corporate networks: Bypasses MPI restrictions

üéâ BENEFITS:
- **Universal compatibility** across all Windows systems
- **No additional software** required (MPI optional)
- **Automatic optimization** based on system capabilities
- **Error-free execution** regardless of MPI availability
- **Maintains ORCA functionality** in all scenarios

üìã VERIFICATION:
To verify the fix is working, check the console output:
- Look for "MPI available - parallel execution enabled" OR
- Look for "MPI not available - forcing serial execution"
- Both scenarios will work correctly

üîß ADVANCED USERS:
If you want to force parallel execution on a system with MPI:
1. Ensure mpiexec is in your system PATH
2. Install Microsoft MPI or Intel MPI
3. Restart ORCAView - it will automatically detect and use MPI

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Serial execution is slightly slower but fully functional
- All ORCA features work in both serial and parallel modes
- The fix is transparent - no user configuration needed
- Performance impact is minimal for small-medium molecules
